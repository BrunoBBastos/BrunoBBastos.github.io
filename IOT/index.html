	<h3>Mordred's Song</h3>
	<h4 id = "result">- by Blind Guardian</h4>
	<p>I've lost my battle before it starts<br>
	My first breath wasn't done<br>
	My spirit's sunken deep into the ground<br>
	Why am I alone?<br>
	I can hear my heartbeat<br>
	Silence's all around<br>
	See hate will rise<br>
	So don't come closer<br>
	Fear your child<br>
	Born with a king's heart<br>
	But fate fooled me and changed my cards<br>
	No one asked if I want it if I like it<br>
	Pain inside is rising<br>
	I am the fallen one<br>
	A figure in an old game<br>
	No Joker's on my side<br>
	I plunged into misery<br>
	I'll turn off the light<br>
	And murder the dawn<br>
	Turn off the light<br>
	And murder the dawn<br>
	Nothing else<br>
	But laughter is around me<br>
	Forevermore<br>
	No one can heal me<br>
	Nothing can save me<br>
	No one can heal me<br>
	I've gone beyond the truth<br>
	It's just another lie<br>
	Wash away the blood on my hands<br>
	My father's blood<br>
	In agony we're unified<br>
	I never wanted to be<br>
	What they told me to be<br>
	Fulfill my fate then I'll be free<br>
	God knows how long<br>
	I tried to change fate<br>
	Pain inside is rising<br>
	I am the fallen one<br>
	A figure in an old game<br>
	No Joker's on my side<br>
	I plunged into misery<br>
	I'll turn off the light<br>
	And murder the dawn<br>
	Turn off the light<br>
	And murder the dawn<br>
	I plunged into misery<br>
	I'll turn off the light<br>
	And murder the dawn<br>
	Turn off the light<br>
	And murder the dawn<br></p>
